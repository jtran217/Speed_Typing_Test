# Speed_Typing_Test

This typing speed test GUI was made with TKinter in Python. The purpose is to measure the number of correctly typed word per minute given a random set of sentence.

HOW TO USE:

1) A random sentence is given, if user does not like the sentence hitting the "RESET" button will generate a new sentence.
2) User then hit start to start the timer and type in the entry box to the best of their ability (NOTE: double spacing can result in huge error in calculating estimated word per minute).
3) Once user is done typing sentence they will click the "RESULT" button, which will return the estimated Words typed per minute and how long it took the user to write the sentence.
